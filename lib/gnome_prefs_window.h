/* Common notice 
 *
 * The created widgets are associated to a GConf key. They have the value
 * of the GConf key as initial value and they get updated when the GConf
 * value changes.
 *
 * You have to create a prefs window with gnome_prefs_window_new. You
 * can create categories of options with gnome_prefs_window_section_new
 * and subcategories with gnome_prefs_window_subsection_new. You can fill in
 * those subcategories by blocks of options using gnome_prefs_subsection_new
 * and then add entries, toggles and such to those blocks using
 * the functions below.
