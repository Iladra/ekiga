<div align="center"><h1>Using Ekiga through DBUS</h1></div>

<h1>Forewords</h1>
This DBUS interface to ekiga is there to make it possible to control ekiga through
freedesktop.org's DBUS messaging system. The idea behind the development of this
software component was to make at least parts of ekiga available nicely to other programs
(be they desktop applications or scripts).

The ekiga team is well aware that this interface is not complete, and plans on improving
it in future releases. We still hope it will be of some use in its current form though.

<h1>Generalities</h1>

There are a few important things which should be kept in mind :
<ul>
<li>when ekiga gives some information through DBUS, this information may already be obsolete
when it has gone through</li>

<li>when ekiga is ordered to do something through DBUS, there is no guarantee that it will be
able to handle the task</li>

<li>ekiga receives orders through its main user interface and possibly through several DBUS programs:
you're not alone!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us see how ekiga would work to deal with a list of objects ('foo'), each having
an integer property (bar), and a state (state). (Notice: the reader familiar with the way rosters
are managed in XMPP/jabber will certainly feel at home with that organisation)</p>

<p>All such objects will have a unique string identifier/token/hash. Ekiga will tell us about those
objects with two signals:
<ul>
<li>FooState, which comes with the token and the associated state</li>
<li>FooBar, which comes with the token and the associated bar property</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>One of the state will be 'invalid', and will be emitted by ekiga to tell us one object was removed from
the list. We will know an object was added to the list when we receive either FooState or FooBar about it.
</p>

<p>This already allows a program watching for the signals to display the list and objects,
and update it when it changes, with one caveat : if we launch the watcher after ekiga,
we will not know the initial list!
</p>

<p>This is the reason why ekiga will provide us the exceptional GetFooList method.
It is exceptional because it returns something, namely the list of current valid identifiers.
Beware that our example watcher should first start to watch the signals,
and only then use GetFooList: remember that the list may be obsolete when we get it!
</p>

<p>Once we have the list of identifiers, we can use the ResignalFooInfo method to ask ekiga to emit signals
about the given identifier (this method doesn't return anything in itself).
If the identifier is invalid (or has become since we got it!),
ekiga will emit the FooState signal with the invalid state.
</p>

<p>This part of the programming interface is enough to allow a watcher to display the list properly,
and update it whenever it changes. Now what if don't want to just look at the list, but also act on it?
</p>

<p>Ekiga may give us a DeleteFoo signal to remove an object from the list.
This method won't return anything,
but ekiga will emit the FooState signal in 'invalid' state if it worked.
</p>

<p>Similarly, we may perhaps be allowed to add an object
with a CreateFoo method, which would receive the value to give to the bar property.
The method could either return the identifier of the new object,
or nothing depending on the situation.
Ekiga will emit the signals if the creation happened.
</p>

<p>Finally, changing the value of the bar property, if possible, would be done with a SetFooBar method,
which would receive the identifier and the new value.
If things go well, ekiga will then emit the FooBar signal to tell us about the new value.
</p>

<p>This little example interface is representative of how the other ekiga interfaces work, and hopefully
the presentation makes it clear how to use it.
</p>

<p>You can read directly in
<a href='http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnomemeeting/src/components/dbus_stub.xml?view=markup''>this file</a>
the current(cvs) list of interfaces available in ekiga, with their list of methods and signals.
The rest of this document is a complement to this file and will try to make things more explicit.
</p>

<h1>The net.ekiga.accounts interface</h1>

<p>Ekiga doesn't allow to do and know much about the available accounts. The interface is pretty
straightforward ; the only thing needing more discussion is the semantics of the state integer.
</p>

<p> The state can take three values:
<ul>
	<li>0: invalid</li>
	<li>1: unregistered</li>
	<li>2: registered</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>The net.ekiga.calls interface</h1>

<p>This interface allows to control the calls in which ekiga takes part. This is currently a little
stupid since ekiga can only handle one, but we left room for future improvements.</p>

<p>Let us begin this tour by documenting the semantics of the call states:
<ul>
	<li>0: invalid</li>
	<li>1: standby</li>
	<li>2: calling (we called the other end, it is ringing, we wait for an answer)</li>
	<li>3: connected (the call is running normally)</li>
	<li>4: called (someone is trying to call us, ekiga rings, waiting for us to answer)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Ekiga allows to add and remove calls from the list, using the Connect and Disconnect methods, whose
meaning should be pretty clear. Notice that Connect returns the call token,
so if we decide to call someone we can track what happened.
</p>

<p>Here are the various informations we can have about a call (not all of them may be available!):
<ul>
	<li>StateChanged: gives the state of the call, as documented</li>
	<li>NameInfo: the name of the remote party</li>
	<li>ClientInfo: the name and version of the remote program</li>
	<li>UrlInfo: the address of the remote party</li>
	<li>ProtocolInfo: which protocol does the call use (SIP, H.323, ...)</li>
	<li>OnHoldInfo: is the call put on hold?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The PlayPause method is used to put the call on hold, or release it from the hold. The Transfer method
is when you want to send the remote party to talk to someone else.
</p>


<h1>The net.ekiga.self interface</h1>

<p>This interface allows to get more information about ekiga's running instance.
</p>

<p>It has simple methods like GetName, GetLocation and GetComment which allows to get what the user said
in the preferences. The Shutdown command allows to quit ekiga.
</p>

<p>And it has an interesting GetLocalAddress method, which allows to know which address to use to contact
the user. You have to give it the protocol in which the address should be given (beware that it's reliable
mostly for SIP). The goal of that method is to allow other programs, for example XMPP/jabber clients,
to make us available for calls.
</p>

<h1>The helper</h1>

<p>Since launching ekiga to have only basic informations would be bad (it is a rather big program),
it comes with a helper program, which can take requests on its behalf for easy questions.
</p>

<p>Of course, this helper is short-lived and exits automatically quite fast, so it is always in sync
with the available ekiga.
</p>

<p>The current helper knows only two methods:
<ul>
	<li>GetVersion, which returns the version of ekiga available</li>
	<li>GetSupportedProtocols, which returns a string list of the supported protocols (needed for example
	by jabber/XMPP clients which would like to know what type of URI can be negociated)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To be completed(FIXME)
</p>
