A list of UI issues and their status.
--================================--

Thanks to Calum @ Sun for creating this list

All is marked with one of [NONE|INPROGRESS|FIXED|DONTFIX]

Configuration assistant
-----------------------

page 1/6:

- Title: "Configuration Assistant", should perhaps be "Configuration
  Druid" to match the titlebar and the main text on the page?  (I'm not a
  big fan of the term "druid" admittedly, but as long as that's what we're
  calling these things...)

  Comment: Druid is not so easy to translate and will often result in
  longer strings

  Status: [NONE]

- That's quite a solid block of introductory text, you could maybe
  insert a blank line before "Once you have completed..." to break it up a
  bit.

  Status: [NONE]

- "Welcome to... the configuration druid" sounds a little odd, either
  "Welcome to GnomeMeeting", or "This is the GnomeMeeting general
  configuration druid" would sound better IMHO.

  Status: [NONE]

- "Once you have completed... you can always change them later in the
  preferences".  If all the things you can set here live in the same
  Preferences dialog, might be nicer to say where the preferences dialog
  is.  E.g. "Once you have completed these steps, you can always change
  them later by selecting Preferences on the Edit menu".

  Status: [NONE]

Page 2/6:

- Not sure that italics are the best choice for the description at the
  top of each page, italics are generally the hardest fonts to read
  on-screen.  Especially on Sun machines that don't support anti-aliasing

  Status: [NONE]

- Suggest "Personal Information" rather than "Personal Data".

  Status: [NONE]

- "This information will be used when connecting to remote H.323
  software".  I have no idea what "H.323 software" is, and I'm sure most
  GnomeMeeting users won't either, definitely not the sort of jargon you
  should be using in a druid :)

  Status: [NONE]

- "Do not register me to ILS": what is ILS?  Is this the "directory of
  GnomeMeeting users" mentioned in the page description?  If so, you
  should use that description with the checkbox, too.

  Status: [NONE]

- 'Comment' field: what is this comment used for?  It's not clear just
  by looking at the dialog.

  Status: [NONE]


- 'Location': I guess you could maybe be more specific here about what
  sort of location you're looking for... country, town, city, "in bed" or
  whatever :)

  Status: [NONE]

- Text fields: should all have mnemonics, and only the first word should
  be capitalised.  I.e. "First name:", "Last name:", and "Email address". 
  (Not "E-mail" address, btw, according to the Documentation Styleguide
  IIRC).

  Status: [NONE]

- Current HIG style for frames is to use bold title and no frame lines,
  you should probably use that here.  This applies to all pages, but I
  won't mention it again...

  Status: [NONE]

Page 3/6:

- Maybe suggest "Network Connection" rather than "Connection Type".
 
  Status: [NONE]

- "it is possible to tweak and change"... these two words mean much the
  same thing, but "change" is probably much easier to localise :)  Suggest
  just saying "it is possible to change".

  Status: [NONE]

- "Custom" type... what happens if I select this?  Where do I get the
  chance to specify what type of connection I *do* have?  Shouldn't there
  be some page or control in the druid that lets me do this?  Also,
  "Other" is perhaps a slightly more accurate word than "Custom" for a
  network connection.

  Status: [NONE]

Page 4/6:

- "You can also choose to use a Quicknet device"... what's that?  How
  does a user know they've got one?  How do I choose one if I have it?  If
  I don't have to do anything special, there probably isn't any point in
  mentioning it, and if I do it should say what I need to do :)

  Status: [NONE]

- "Some webcam models have an internal microphone that can be used with
  GnomeMeeting".  So what do I need to do to set up one of those?  How is
  it different from setting up any other sort of microphone?  Again, if
  it's the same, I'm not sure there's any point in mentioning it.  Nobody
  reads that part of the screen anyway :)

  Status: [NONE]

- Suggest just "Player" and "Recorder" rather than "Audio Player" and
  "Audio Recorder".  The "Audio" is kind of redundant given the name of
  the frame.

  Status: [NONE]

- Click here to test your audio devices:"... couldn't you just lose this
  label and write "Test Audio" on the button?

  Status: [NONE]

Page 5/6:

- "Test Video" is probably better than "Video Test"; buttons should
  generally have verbs on them.

  Status: [NONE]

- What is that progress indicator-looking thing for?  :)  (I assume it's
  something to do with the video test...)

  Status: [NONE]

Page 6/6:

- "Done!"  Exclamation marks usually look a bit unprofessional :) 
  "Finished" or "Configuration Complete" might be better...

  Status: [NONE]

- "Changes Summary" should perhaps be "Configuration Summary"?  After
  all, if this is the first time you've set up GnomeMeeting, you haven't
  really 'changed' anything.

  Status: [NONE]

Main Window
-----------

main_gui.jpg:

- The spacing between the menu items looks unusually wide, have you
  inserted extra spaces here somehow?

  Status: [NONE]

- The HIG still recommends against vertical toolbars, but I know we've
  talked about that before :)  Do these toolbar buttons have no labels
  even if the user switches on labels in the desktop Menus & Toolbars
  preferences dialog?  It's kind of bad if that's the case, there should
  probably at least be some option somewhere that allows the user to have
  labels on the buttons.

  Status: [NONE]

- Would be nice if the 'callto:' field had a label (with a mnemonic),
  like the location bar in most browsers, although I appreciate that would
  eat up some space :/  Failing that, is there a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+L
  or something) that will give focus to it?

  Status: [NONE]

main_gui2.jpg:

- "Send Message:" should probably be left-aligned with the text field,
  not right-aligned.

  Status: [NONE]

- Frame around Text Chat probably not really needed, a label would
  suffice I think.

  Status: [NONE]

main_gui3.jpg:

- Again, the frames on the statistics/audio/video tabs aren't really
  needed-- the tab itself frames the controls nicely enough, and provides
  a label without having to repeat it here.

  Status: [NONE]

- I hope it's possible to change the colours on the statistics graph, to
  keep Bill and the accessibility team happy :)

  Status: [NONE]

main_gui4.jpg:

- Although they look cool, controls that only have graphics for labels
  could be a bit of an accessibility problem too... admittedly you can
  provide accessible descriptions for them in the code that a screenreader
  can pick up, but that doesn't help you if your eyesight is poor but not
  bad enough to need a screenreader :)  You also can't assign mnemonics to
  graphical labels.  So I'd suggest adding textual labels to the audio and
  video settings controls as well if possible.

  Status: [NONE]

Cheeri,
Calum.
