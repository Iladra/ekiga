	* src/config.cpp, src/endpoint.cpp, src/common.h, src/preferences.cpp:
	Added support for multiple soundcards, you can now use a different soundcard
	(or webcam) as sound recorder device and sound player device.
	The Audio Settings part of the GnomeMeeting control panel still needs to be
	updated.

	* src/main_interface.cpp: fixed the -a bug (when GnomeMeeting is run with
	the -a applet, if you close the window with the WM, GnomeMeeting will be 
	closed and not hidden). See gtk_signal_connect ().

	* src/endpoint.cpp: added message in the history to show the devices used
	for recording and playing.
