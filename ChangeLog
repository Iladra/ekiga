Version 0.10 - 13/08/01
 
* GnomeMeeting 0.10 will compile with the newest versions of OpenH323
and PWLib and with the CVS.  You need to use OpenH323 >= 1.6.0 and PWLib
>= 1.1.36

* The applet is now optional. GnomeMeeting can be started with the -a
option.

* The applet is resizeable following the panel size.

use.  A video test button has been added in the preferences.  If you
click on Apply and the settings are not correct, you will have a warning
and gnomemeeting will transmit a test picture during a call.

* It is now possible to modify the brightness, contrast, whiteness, and
colour level during calls.

* Several memory leaks have been fixed.

* The GnomeMeeting logo is displayed again at the end of each call
instead of the last transmitted / received picture.

Info", "History", "Audio Settings", "Video Settings"
