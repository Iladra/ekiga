	freezing the main interface while waiting that the GMH323Webcam class
	(for example) stops to grab.
	* src/ldap.cpp, src/ldap_h.h: The LDap window is not anymore destroyed
	and rebuilt each time, but only shown/hidden.

	destructor is called (we wait some time => the destructor can take
	some time to execute).
	* src/ils.cpp, src/ils.h:  Added mutexes to cleanly quit when the
