GENERAL QUESTIONS :

1.  What is GnomeMeeting  ?

	GnomeMeeting is an H.323 compatible client designed for the Gnome desktop.
	It is compatible with Netmeeting and other H.323 products.

2.  Is it free software  ?

	Yes, it is licensed under the GPL.

3.  How much do I have to pay for it  ?

	1000 USD.  No !  Nothing because it is free software,
	free as free speech, but also free as free beer  !

4.  Who is the author of that software  ?

	The author is Damien Sandras <dsandras@seconix.com>
	GnomeMeeting was developed as a master thesis 
	at the "Université Catholique de Louvain" in Belgium 
	(see http://www.ucl.ac.be)

5.  Do I need a webcam to run GnomeMeeting  ?

	No, a soundcard is enough.

6.  Which type of camera can I use with GnomeMeeting  ?

	Every camera supported by the Linux kernel and 
	that understands the Video4Linux API 
	(Philips webcams, Creative webcams, and many others...)

7.  Does it run under KDE  ?

	Yes, provided you have installed the gnome libraries.
	If you get errors, just disable the applet : use the -a or 
	--noapplet option at startup.

8.  Does it work behind a NAT  ?

	Yes, but people will be unable to call you.
	The appropriate module can be found on :
	http://www.coritel.it/coritel/ip/sofia/nat/nat2/nat2.htm
	However this module is not very stable and only works with the 2.2 kernel.
	Another solution would be to install the OpenH323Proxy
	(http://openh323proxy.sourceforge.net/) or the OpenMCU (http://www.openh323.org/code.html)
	and install it on your firewall.

9.  What is the licence  ?

	GnomeMeeting is licensed under the GPL license and as a special exception,
	you have permission to link or otherwise combine this program 
	with the programs OpenH323 and Pwlib, and distribute the combination, 
	without applying the requirements of the GNU GPL to the OpenH323 program, 
	as long as you do follow the requirements  of the GNU GPL for all 
	the rest of the software thus combined.

	or http://www.openldap.org

2.  How can I compile GnomeMeeting  ?

        Simply use the binaries from your distribution, the ones in the download 
	section, or :

	As root, follow the steps :

	1) pwlib

	* download it either on http://www.gnomemeeting.org/downloads
	* extract it : tar xvzf pwlib_min_1.1.37.tar.gz

 	 e.g. : bjack@localhost:~/$ export PWLIBDIR=/opt/pwlib
	* cd into the directory where you extracted it
	* make opt (from the directory where you extracted pwlib)
	* do the following :

	localhost:/opt/pwlib/lib# cp libpt_linux_x86_r.so.1.1.37 /usr/local/lib
	localhost:/opt/pwlib/lib# ln -s /usr/local/lib/libpt_linux_x86_r.so.1.1.37

	2) openh323

	* download it either on http://www.gnomemeeting.org/downloads
	* extract it :  tar xvzf openh323_1.6.1.tar.gz 
	* export OPENH323DIR=the directory where you extracted openh323
	* cd into the directory where you extracted it
	* make opt (from the directory where you extracted openh323)
	* do the following :

	localhost:/opt/pwlib/lib# cp libh323_linux_x86_r.so.1.6.1 /usr/local/lib
	localhost:/opt/pwlib/lib# ln -s /usr/local/lib/libh323_linux_x86_r.so.1.6.1 
	/usr/local/lib/libh323_linux_x86_r.so

	localhost:/opt/pwlib/lib# ln -s /usr/local/lib/libh323_linux_x86_r.so.1.6.1 
	/usr/local/lib/liboh323.so

	* run ldconfig

	If any problem, please have a look at openh323 FAQ :
	http://www.openh323.org/

	3) OpenLDAP

	* check if it is installed in /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib

	* if it is not, download it on http://www.openldap.org
 	 (perhaps you could install the rpm...)
	
	4) GnomeMeeting

	* download it on http://www.gnomemeeting.org/downloads

	* cd into the directory where you exctracted
	* run the ./configure script that supports several parameters :

	--prefix=/usr  to install it in /usr
	--with-pt-includes= specifies the location of PTlib headers (for example,
	/opt/pwlib/include/ptlib if you extracted PWlib in /opt, default is /usr/include/ptlib)
	--with-pt-libs= specifies the location of the PTlib libraries
	--with-h323-includes= specifies the location of OpenH323 headers
	--with-h323-libs= specifies the location of the OpenH323 libraries

	* make
	* make install

3.  Can I use another version of OpenH323 and PWlib than the versions 
    provided in the download section  ?

	Yes, if these versions are newer. Don't use old version of the libraries.


4.  Is there a CVS  ?

	Yes, the CVS of GnomeMeeting is located in the Gnome CVS.
	(see http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html for details, the GnomeMeeting module
	name is gnomemeeting)


FEATURES QUESTIONS  :

1.  Can I register on ILS directories  ?

	Yes, but some directories can give error messages and deny 
	GnomeMeeting to register.

2.  Will Netmeeting users be able to see me  ?

	No, because Netmeeting asks to the ILS directory to list people 
	using Netmeeting and not other software like GnomeMeeting, but you will 
	be able to see those people and contact them.  

3.  How can I see the history of the operations  ?

	Right-click on "Remote User Info" at the bottom of the window, and 
	choose history in the menu or choose this option in the View menu.

4.  How can I change the speaker and microphone volume  ?

	Right-click on "Remote User Info" at the bottom of the window, and 
	choose Audio Settings in the menu or choose this option in the View menu.

5.  How can I change the camera settings  ?

	Right-click on "Remote User Info" at the bottom of the window, and 
	choose Video Settings in the menu or choose this option in the View menu.
	It is only possible to change these settings during a call.

6.  How can I see the remote user and myself in the interface  ?

	Right-click on the webcam image and choose "Both" in the menu.

7.  How can I change the sound that is played on incoming calls  ?

	You can change it in the Gnome Control Center.

8.  What is the best audio codec  ?

	GSM.  GSM is not supported by Microsoft Netmeeting, but you can add it 
	to Netmeeting. Just download the executable in the download section.

9.  How can I send a test picture to the remote endpoint if I have no webcam  ?

	You can always select "Enable Video Transmission".  When clicking on Apply,
	you will get a warning but a test picture will be sent to the remote 
	endpoint during calls.

10. How can I share my desktop or make a text chat with Netmeeting  ?

        It is impossible.  This kind of things is based on the T.120 protocol.
        GnomeMeeting currently only supports the H.323 protocol for 
	video-conferencing, but it doesn't prevent you to try to implement that
	protocol or to use dedicated software like VNC or ICQ for that purpose.
