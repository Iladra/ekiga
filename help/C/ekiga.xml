<title>Introduction</title>

<para><title>Ekiga</title></para>
<para><application>&app;</application> is a free Voice over IP, IP Telephony and Video-Conferencing application for Linux and other Unices (e.g BSD, OpenSolaris or MacOSX). It was written by Damien Sandras and is licensed under the GNU/GPL.
</para>

<para>
Ekiga is able to use modern Voice over IP protocols like SIP, and H.323. It supports all major features defined by those protocols like <emphasis>call hold</emphasis>, <emphasis>call transfer</emphasis>, <emphasis>call forwarding</emphasis>, ... It also supports basic <emphasis>instant messaging</emphasis>, and has advanced support for <emphasis>NAT traversal</emphasis>.
Ekiga supports the best <emphasis>free</emphasis> audio and video codecs, and has wideband support for a superior audio quality, together with echo cancellation.
</para>

<para><title>SIP and H.323</title></para>
<para>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol developed by the IETF MMUSIC Working Group and proposed standard for initiating, modifying, and terminating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video, voice, instant messaging, online games, and virtual reality. In November 2000, SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture. It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP.
</para>

<para>
H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks. One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards, not only defining the basic call model, but in addition the supplementary services, needed to address business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems.

<graphic fileref="figures/stats.png"></graphic>

<para>To view the statistics, please select the Statistics tab in the control panel.</para>

<para>The statistic visualizes the network traffic caused by <application>&app;</application>. It draws a graph for each RTP stream. This means that - if audio and video are enabled in <application>&app;</application> and the client of the remote party - you will see four different graphs. (incoming audio stream, incoming video stream, outgoing audio stream, outgoing video stream)</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Lost packets: The percentage of lost packets, ie of packets from the remote user that you did not receive. A too high packets loss during the reception can result in voice and/or video distortion and is usually caused by a bad network provider or by settings requiring much bandwidth.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Late packets: The percentage of late packets, ie of packets from the remote user that you received but too late to be taken into account, <application>&app;</application> being sending and receiving real-time video and audio.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Round-trip delay: The required time for a packet to arrive at its destination and come back. You can see the Round-Trip delay during a call as a connection quality indicator together with the Lost and Late packets statistics.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Jitter buffer: The Jitter buffer is the buffer where received sound packets are accumulated. When the buffer is full, then the sound is played. If your network is of bad quality, then you need a big jitter buffer, ie a big delay before sound is played back, because you need more time before being able to play audio back.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para><title>Adjusting the audio and video settings</title></para>

<para>Your audio and video settings can be adjusted through the control panel while you are in a call.

<para><title>Managing my contacts with the Address Book</title></para>
<para>
The Address Book is a feature which allows you to find users to call and/or to save locally your list of persons that you call on a regular basis. It respectively loads the list of users from the LDAP directory and will store locally their addresses and associated speed dials (if any).
</para>

<para><title>Basics of the Address Book</title></para>
<para>
To open the Address Book, select Tools -> Address Book and the <application>&app;</application> Addressbook window should appear. To your left there will be a list dialog showing the Servers you have added to the list as well as a list of local Address Books.

</para>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> is able to use several types of address books, allowing to search for remote contacts, and bookmark local contacts. The most common address book type is the LDAP directory where you can find information about registered users. <application>&app;</application> is able to browse any LDAP directory and use a specific attribute as calling URL. For example, you could have an LDAP directory in your company, with a specific attribute containing the local extensions of all your colleagues. <application>&app;</application> is able to use such an LDAP directory. Simply select in File -> New Address Book, and choose remote LDAP as type.
</para>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> is also able to detect other <application>&app;</application> users on the LAN using the Bonjour technology popularized by Apple (tm). That supposes you have a local mDNSResponder daemon running on your computer. Finally, <application>&app;</application> is able to bookmark contacts in the local address book, shared with the <ulink url="http://www.novell.com/products/evolution" type="http">Novell Evolution</ulink> suite.
</para>

<para>
To refresh the list of users for a specific address book, simply click the Find button. It will search for all users in that address book. You can contact people by double clicking on their highlighted field. You can also Drag-and-Drop to call a specific party by selecting the highlighted field and dragging it into the Main Window.
</para>

<para>
In certain cases you will want to search specifically for a person name, his or her call URL, or his location in the <application>&app;</application> white pages. The address book window allows you to apply filters when searching for contacts. 
</para>

<tip><title>Tip</title><para>The <application>&app;</application> white pages will allow you to look for users in your region. It returns a limited number of results corresponding to your search. If the user is associated to a red icon, it means that he is online. If he is associated to a greyed out icon, it means he is offline. You can then add him to your personal address book to call him later.</para></tip>

<para>Callto URL's and H.323 URL's are formatted exactly the same except however callto urls also support ILS lookups through callto URLS of the type: callto:ils_server/user_mail.</para>

<para>For example, calling <emphasis>callto:ils.seconix.com/joe.user@somedomain.com</emphasis> will look for the user with the joe.user@somedomain.com email address on the ILS server ils.seconix.com and proceed to initate a call.</para>

<para><title>Speed dials</title></para>
<para>
<application>&app;</application> is able to associate speed dials with URLs using the address book. You can thus for example associate the speed dial <emphasis>1</emphasis> to the URL <emphasis>sip:600000@ekiga.net</emphasis>. That speed dial can then be used as URL. For example, calling <emphasis>sip:1#</emphasis> will call <emphasis>sip:600000@ekiga.net</emphasis> provided that both are associated together in the address book.

<sect2 id="ekiga-video-bandwidth">
<title>Controlling the Video Bandwidth</title>

<para><application>&app;</application> is using a best-effort algorithm to maintain a low bandwidth when transmitting video. You can adjust the video quality settings following you prefer to have a good frame rate, or a good picture quality. It will permit <application>&app;</application> to dynamically adjust the video bandwidth and the number of transmitted images per second during a call while trying to respect the requested video bandwidth.</para>

<para>Notice that the algorithm is a best-effort algorithm, which means that if you specify too low video bandwidth settings, it can be impossible to respect them. However, if the video bandwidth permits to transmit with a better quality, or faster than the requested values, then <application>&app;</application> will dynamically increase them so that the quality and the framerate are always the best possible.</para>

<para>Choosing a higher framerate and a lower quality will have the same result in terms of video bandwidth than choosing a higher quality with a lower framerate. It depends if you prefer using your bandwidth to transmit more lower quality images or fewer big quality images.</para>

<sect2 id="ekiga-audio-codecs">
<title>Managing Codecs</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/audio_codecs.png"></graphic>

<para><title>Audio Codecs</title></para>
<para>
The <application>&app;</application> audio codecs table in the preferences permits you to change the codecs order as well as disabling the codecs you don't want to use. Each codec has strong and weak points. For example, G.711 will give the best voice quality but will use the most bandwidth while SPEEX will give an average voice quality but requiring a very low bandwidth usage. Notice that there are two versions of SPEEX, one of them is SPEEX WideBand. You can see that to the 16 kHz clock rate.</para>

<para><title>Reordering the codecs</title></para>
<para>
When you reorder the codecs, you are reordering the local capabilities table, ie the codecs you will use for sending. You will always transmit audio using the first codec in the table that is in common with the remote user. The remote user will transmit audio using the first codec in his table that is common with you.</para>

<para><title>Forcing the use of a specific codec</title></para>
<para>
You can force the use of a specific codec by disabling all other codecs, but it will result in failed calls if the remote user doesn't allow that specific codec. The best is to put your prefered codecs at the top of the list so that you always transmit with them if the remote user allows it and to disable the codecs that you don't want to use for transmission and reception.</para>

<para><title>Adjusting the jitter buffer</title></para>
<para>
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment. If there is too much packets loss, the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer. In such a case, the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality. A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds, resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality. Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission, and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value, but to bad internet connection quality.

<sect2 id="ekiga-defining-ports">
<title>Changing Ports</title>

<para><title>The listen ports</title></para>
<para>
The main port listening for incoming connections in <application>&app;</application> for SIP is port 5060 (UDP), while 1720 (TCP) is used by H.323. To change those ports you need to load "gconf-editor". Open gconf-editor, select apps from the left hand side menu and then select <application>&app;</application>. Then select "sip" or "h323", it should give you a list in the corresponding window to your right. Select listen_port and change it to your desired value. You can also change the UDP/RTP port ranges.
</para>

<para><title>Explanation of the port ranges</title></para>

<para>1. The "listen_port" value is the port <application>&app;</application> will listen for incoming connections on. It is different for SIP and H.323.</para>

<para>2. The "rtp_port_range" value is the range of UDP ports that <application>&app;</application> will use for RTP (audio and video communication channels). <application>&app;</application> needs to be restarted for the new values to take effect.</para>

<para>3. The "udp_port_range" value is the range of UDP ports that <application>&app;</application> will use for SIP signalling or when registering to H.323 gatekeepers.</para>

<para>4. The "tcp_port_range" value is the range of TCP ports beside the listen_port that <application>&app;</application> will use for the H.245 channel with the H.323 protocol. That port range is not used by SIP. It is not used either when H.245 Tunneling is enabled, which is in general always the case, except when calling old H.323 implementations like Netmeeting.</para>

<title>Controlling the SIP Settings</title>

<para><title>Misc Settings</title></para>
<para><emphasis>Outbound Proxy</emphasis></para>
<para>The outbound proxy is the SIP proxy that will relay your calls. The behavior of a SIP proxy is similar to the behavior of an HTTP proxy, ie some entity that issues the requests on your behalve and proxies the streams.</para>

<para><emphasis>Forward URL</emphasis></para>
<para>The URL to which SIP incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences.</para>

<sect2 id="ekiga-h323">
<title>Controlling the H.323 Settings</title>

<para><title>Misc Settings</title></para>
<para><emphasis>Default gateway</emphasis></para>
<para>The default gateway is the H.323 gateway to use when doing calls. For example, if you are calling <emphasis>h323:123443</emphasis> with a default gateway set to <emphasis>foo</emphasis>, gateway foo will dial 123443 on your behalve. Usually, you will be registered to a gatekeeper, and gateway is not used.</para>

<para><emphasis>Forward URL</emphasis></para>
<para>The URL to which H.323 incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences.</para>

<para><title>Advanced Settings</title></para>
<para><application>&app;</application> permits a fine control of the H.323 settings in the Advanced H.323 Settings section of the preferences. You can enable H.245 Tunneling, Early H.245 and Fast Start.</para>

<para><emphasis>H.245 Tunneling</emphasis></para>

<para>H.245 Tunneling is the encapsulation of H.245 messages within H.225/Q.931 messages (H.245 Tunneling). If you have a firewall and enable H.245 Tunneling, there is one less TCP port that you need to allow for incoming connections.</para>

<para><emphasis>Early H.245</emphasis></para>

<para>This enables H.245 early in the setup and permits to achieve faster call initiation.</para>

<para><emphasis>Fast Start</emphasis></para>

<para>Fast Connect is a new method of call setup that bypasses some usual steps in order to make it faster. In addition to the speed improvement, Fast Connect allows the media channels to be operational before the CONNECT message is sent, which is a requirement for certain billing procedures. It was introduced in H.323 version 2.</para>
