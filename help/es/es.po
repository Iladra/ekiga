"<application>GnomeMeeting</application> is a free audio/video-conferencing "

"by Damien Sandras and is licensed under the GNU/GPL. It is based on the "
"H.323 ITU standard and allows you to make audio and video calls to remote "
"users with H.323 hardware or software (such as Microsoft Netmeeting). It "
"also supports all modern videoconferencing features, such as registering to "
"an Internet Locator Service (ILS) directory, gatekeeper support, making "
"multi-user conference calls using an external Multipoint Control Unit (MCU), "
"using modern Quicknet telephony cards and making PC-To-Phone calls."
