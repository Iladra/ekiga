Developers:
- Please keep the current coding style in Ekiga and put comments.
  Functions descriptions should have 3 fields: DESCRIPTION, BEHAVIOR
  and PRE.  PRE means the set of conditions on the parameters to be
  sure that the function works.  See src/gui/main.h for an example.
- Any new file you create must start with the license preamble and the
  short file description, see src/gui/main.cpp for an example
- About gconf: All notifiers and all gconf_client_notify_add must be
  in config.cpp.  The callback that updates the gconf cache must be
  located in the file containing the widget associated to the
  callback.  Some general callbacks for toggles, entries, option menus
  are located in gconf.cpp.
- Options: Ekiga follows the "Instant Apply" model.
- The way to include things is the following: include the Ekiga
  headers before the others.  All the .h files should contain #include
  "common.h" as first include because it will itself include a ptlib
  file containing compilation flags required to have a well-working
  Ekiga.  The .h corresponding to the .cpp file must be included
  before the other includes.  Libraries headers includes must follow
  the application headers includes.  ../config.h must be included
  before the rest in all .cpp files.
