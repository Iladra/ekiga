- Fixed bug where if a non-INVITE transaction gets a 1xx response, but
  then the 2xx (or above) response is lost, the command is not
  retransmitted

  would not look anywhere but default path

  local user name to the original call

  broken during changes to make calls back into the same stack

  offered then abort the call as this is SO not to specification!
- Fixed possible assertion if the soundcard blocks and prevents the
  device to be closed
- Fixed possible path through unsubscribe/unregister code that could
  lead to a NULL pointer being used
- Fixed issue in SIP registering, if both a full AOR and a registrar
  host name is provided then we would normally disable all registrar
  searches (e.g. SRV record lookup) and just use the host name
  specified
- Change default TSTO in H.263 to give better quality
- Fixed issue with SIP call hairpinning back into the same stack
- Fixed possibility of closing a channel twice
- Fixed intermittent problem with losing an audio channel when using
  INVITE with a replace header

- Don't stop a call from clearing due to lack of media just because a
  session has not received any packets
- Fixed memory leaks in the plugins code
- Improved the RTP stack performances
- Fixed various video payload problems
- Fixed issue with outgoing re-INVITE that gets a 401/407
  authentication required error, the re-transmitted INVITE was not a
  re-INVITE but another normal INVITE, so "hold" doesn't work
- Fixed issue with incoming re-INVITE that has no SDp in the INVITE,
  if the eventual ACK has the same streams but only changed the IP
  address/port for RTP, then we did not change our RTP send
  addresss/port
  Add numerous boundary checks to H.263 codec
- Discard out of order packets, mode A frames that don't begin with a
  start code, and frames that don't begin with a start code in H.263
  codec

  configuration for "don't offer"
